#### Features:

- Messages: The platform should provide a messaging system for users to communicate with each other. This would involve sending and receiving text-based messages.
- Online Status: Users should have an online status indicator to show whether they are currently active on the platform. This can help other users determine who is available for chatting.
- Connect: A "Connect" button would allow users to initiate a conversation with someone they find interesting. It could trigger a request or notification to the recipient, indicating that someone wants to connect with them.
